# @angular-kit

A set of 🔥 Angular packages tools.

- 📦 independent packages
- 🍃 fully tree-shakable as we leverage secondary entry points for each package

## 📦 Included packages

- [stream](./libs/stream/README.md) - the better async pipe
- [rx](./libs/rx/README.md) - reactive tools
- [effects](https://github.com/mikelgo/angular-kit-effects) - modern util to manage subscriptions with zero-boilerplate code
- [rx-hooks](./libs/rx-hooks/README.md) - reactive lifecycle hooks

- [immutable-helper](./libs/immutable-helper/README.md) - immutable helper functions to deal with objects and arrays

## Info
The main branch does always contain the latest version of the packages. If you want to use a specific version, there will be a v.x.x.x-package-name branch (e.g. v.1.x.x-rx-stateful) 
if more than the current version is supported.
